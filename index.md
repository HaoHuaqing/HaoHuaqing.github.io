### Introduction
Welcome to My GitHub Pages,I'm HaoHuaqing,a student,graduated from Sichuan University in July 2016,studying biomedical engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University now.

### Work
In June 2015,I took part in Robomaster National Robotics Competition sponsored by DJI.We designed and manufactured robots in three mouths.The final competition was just like First Person Shooter Game in which five people use computers to operate the robots against the other five people.It's the best competition I have ever entered during my bachelor study.

From March to June in 2016,I did my Graduation Project.Based on Kinect for Xbox One,Kinect for Windows SDK version 2.0,I used Kinect to measure joint angle,which can be used in Rehabilitation Engineering,assessing the effect of patient treatment with non-contact and rapid measurement of the joint angle.You can see the code here:[KinectMeasureJointAngle](https://github.com/HaoHuaqing/KinectMeasureJointAngle)
